**Assignment Overview**

Welcome to the assignment repository! Below are the details of the files you'll find here:

**1. main.py**
- This file serves as the entry point for the program. All other functions will be invoked from here.

**2. cat.py**
- Inside this file, you'll discover the `Cat` class along with its associated methods and attributes(x, y, name).

**3. mouse.py**
- This file houses the `Mouse` class along with its related methods and attributes(x, y).

**4. distance.py**
- Within this file, you'll find functions dedicated to determining the distances between all cats and the mouse. 
  Additionally, it hosts the function `find_cat_min_distance_with_mouse`, which identifies the closest cat to the mouse.

**5. series.py**
- Here resides the `get_val_from_series` function, designed to extract the values of x and y from a given pair, a and b. 
  This function handles positive values and ensures that no negative values are erroneously inputted, as the series does not accommodate negativity.

**6. util.py**
- Lastly, this file contains a simple yet handy function called `print_line()`, which aids in visually separating different parts of the program's output.

Feel free to explore these files to gain a comprehensive understanding of the assignment.
